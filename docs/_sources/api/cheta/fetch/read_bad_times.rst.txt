cheta.fetch.read_bad_times
==========================

.. py:function:: cheta.fetch.read_bad_times(table)

   
   Include a list of bad times from ``table`` in the fetch module
   ``bad_times`` registry.  This routine can be called multiple times with
   different tables and the bad times will be appended to the registry.  The
   table can include any number of bad time interval specifications, one per
   line.  A bad time interval line has three columns separated by whitespace,
   e.g.::

     aogbias1  2008:292:00:00:00  2008:297:00:00:00

   The MSID name is not case sensitive and the time values can be in any
   ``DateTime`` format.  Blank lines and any line starting with the #
   character are ignored.
