cheta.fetch.local_or_remote_function
====================================

.. py:function:: cheta.fetch.local_or_remote_function(remote_print_output)

   
   Decorator maker so that a function gets run either locally or remotely
   depending on the state of remote_access.access_remotely.  This decorator
   maker takes an optional remote_print_output argument that will be
   be printed (locally) if the function is executed remotely,

   For functions that are decorated using this wrapper:

   Every path that may be generated locally but used remotely should be
   split with _split_path(). Conversely the functions that use
   the resultant path should re-join them with os.path.join. In the
   remote case the join will happen using the remote rules.
