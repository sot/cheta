cheta.comps.ephem_stk.get_ephemeris_stk
=======================================

.. py:function:: cheta.comps.ephem_stk.get_ephemeris_stk(start, stop)

   
   Get ephemeris data from local STK files, OCCweb, or local cache STK data.

   By default, looks for local STK files in the directory specified by the
   CHETA_EPHEM_STK_DIR environment variable (if not set, uses default of
   platform-dependent standard location). If no local files are found, then
   the search for data looks on OCCweb.

   Returns a structured array with columns time, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz. The time is in
   CXC seconds since 1998.0, and the position and velocity are in meters and
   meters/second, respectively.

   The last result of this function is cached in memory for performance. The memory
   cache is for the common use case of fetching (via fetch.Msid) multiple
   components of the ephemeris over the same time range.

   In addition, STK files are cached on disk as compressed numpy arrays in the
   directory specified by the CHETA_EPHEM_STK_CACHE_DIR environment variable
   (if not set uses default ~/.cheta/cache). This reduces repeated downloads and
   speeds up access to ephemeris data.

   This function also respects the CHETA_EPHEM_DISABLE_LOCAL_STK environment
   variable for testing. If set to "True", then local STK files are not used
   even if available (though note that the lru_cache does not know about environment
   variables, so if the function is called with the same start and stop times as a
   previous call, the cached result will be returned even if the environment variable
   has changed).

   :Parameters:

       **start** : CxoTimeLike
           Start time of interval

       **stop** : CxoTimeLike
           Stop time of interval



   :Returns:

       **dat** : np.ndarray
           Structured array with columns time, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz
