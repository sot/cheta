========================

.. py:function:: cheta.converters.obc4eng(dat)

   
   At 2014:342:XX:XX:XX, patch PR-361 was applied which transitioned 41 OBA thermistors to
   read out in wide-mode.  After this time the data in the listed OOBTHRxx MSIDs became
   invalid while the OOBTHRxx_WIDE MSIDs became valid.  This converter simply copies the
   ``*_WIDE`` values to the original MSIDs after the time of patch activation.

   At 2017:312:16:11:16, patch PR-411 was applied which transitioned 6 OBA thermistors to
   wide-mode and these were added below as patch "c".

   At 2024:102:11:20:00, patch PR-575 was applied which transitioned more HRMA thermistors
   to wide-mode and these patches (noted as A and B in PR-575) are applied as patches d and e
   below.
