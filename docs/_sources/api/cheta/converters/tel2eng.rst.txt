========================

.. py:function:: cheta.converters.tel2eng(dat)

   
   At 2014:342:XX:XX:XX, patch PR-361 was applied which transitioned 41 OBA thermistors to
   read out in wide-mode.  As 4OAVOBAT is an average of all these MSIDs and calculated on board,
   only the wide version of this MSID is valid after this patch is applied.

   This converter simply copies the 4OAVOBAT_WIDE values after the time of patch activation to
   4OAVOBAT.

   At 2024:102:11:20:00, patch PR-575 was applied which transitioned more HRMA thermistors
   to wide-mode and msid 4OAVHRMT required the same update as 4OAVOBAT in 2014.
