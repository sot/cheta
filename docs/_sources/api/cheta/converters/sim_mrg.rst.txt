cheta.converters.sim_mrg
========================

.. py:function:: cheta.converters.sim_mrg(dat)

   
   Custom converter for SIM_MRG.

   There is a bug in CXCDS L0 SIM decom wherein the 3LDRTMEK MSID is
   incorrectly assigned (TSC and FA are reversed).  The calibration
   of 3LDRTPOS from steps to mm is then also wrong because it uses
   the FA conversion instead of TSC.

   This function fixes 3LDRTMEK, then backs out the (incorrect) 3LDRTPOS
   steps to mm conversion and re-does it correctly using the TSC conversion.
   Note that 3LDRTMEK is (by virtue of the way mission operations run)
   always "TSC".
