cheta.utils.get_fetch_size
==========================

.. py:function:: cheta.utils.get_fetch_size(msids, start, stop, stat=None, interpolate_dt=None, fast=True)

   
   Estimate the memory size required to fetch the ``msids`` between ``start`` and
   ``stop``.  This is generally intended for limiting queries to be less than ~100 Mb and
   allows for making some assumptions for improved performance (see below).

   Returns a tuple of the estimated megabytes of memory for the raw fetch and megabytes
   for the final output (which is different only in the case of interpolating).  This is
   done by fetching 3 days of telemetry (2010:001 to 2010:004) and scaling appropriately.

   If ``fast`` is True (default) then if either of the conditions below apply a result of
   (-1, -1) is returned, indicating that the fetch will probably be less than ~100 Mb and
   should be OK.  (This does not account for the number of MSIDs passed in ``msids``).

     - Fetch duration (stop - start) is less than 30 days
     - Fetch ``stat`` is '5min' or 'daily'

   :param msids: list of MSIDs or a single MSID
   :param start: start time
   :param stop: stop time
   :param stat: fetch stat (None|'5min'|'daily', default=None)
   :param interpolate_dt: interpolate the output to uniform time steps (default=None)
   :param fast: return (-1, -1) if conditions on duration / stat (default=True)

   :returns: fetch_Mb, interpolated_Mb
