The cheta telemetry archive tools support a wide
range of formats for representing date-time stamps.  Note that within this and
other documents for this tool suite, the words 'time' and 'date' are used
interchangably to mean a date-time stamp.

The available formats are listed in the table below:

============ =============================================== =======

============ =============================================== =======

``*`` Ambiguous for input parsing and only available as output formats.

For the ``date`` format one can supply only YYYY:DDD in which case 12:00:00.000
is implied.

The default time "System" for the different formats is either ``tt``
(Terrestrial Time) or ``utc`` (UTC).  Since TT differs from UTC by around 64
seconds it is important to be consistent in specifying the time format.
